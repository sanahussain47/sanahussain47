# 👋 Hi, I'm Sana Hussain

🎓 MS Data Science student at ITU  
📊 Data Analyst at the Price Control & Commodities Management Department, Punjab  
🧑‍🏫 Teaching Assistant – Data Analytics at Atomcamp  

A year ago, I didn’t know how much working with data would change the way I see things. My journey truly began with Atomcamp — where I got my first hands-on exposure to data, real-world projects, and a vibrant learning community. That experience gave me clarity, confidence, and the push I needed to step fully into the world of data science. Today, I’m proud to return as a TA, helping others begin their own journey with data.

### 🌱 My Atomcamp Journey
Atomcamp is where it all started — from my first Python notebook to building full data analysis pipelines.  
It’s where I learned that data isn’t just numbers — it’s a way to ask better questions, and solve meaningful problems.  
Fast forward, I still carry that curiosity with me every day — now as a Teaching Assistant, helping others unlock the same excitement and growth.
